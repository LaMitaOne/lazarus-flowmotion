Animated Image Gallery Lazarus-Flowmotion 0.1 alpha   
   
Port of my VCL FLowmotion https://github.com/LaMitaOne/Flowmotion     
   
v0.1 alpha, first running lifesign, thought you would like it in Lazarus community :D  

Never done anything before in lazarus so...no idea what all works and what not, but its starting and animation works so... you can try :D   
  
i said i try make one, and... here it is, i will make more for this too with time.  
I got broke eyes so not hurry too much, and skia / vcl version i got still more to do too      
But since thats the first time i see something of me working in lazarus i will for sure do more there, cant resist :D
